Key Bindings of Tsathoggua

Full viewing of a cube, including camera rotation and movement. The code is
low-tech but very simple. Matrix multiplication is done only on the shader to
save us writing a matrix multiplier in C. This results in there being a lot more
shader uniforms than there has to be, but it doesn't matter for this demo. The
key bindings are pure evil.
